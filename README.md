# About me

I have 15+ years of experience managing analytics teams. Over my career I have touched most areas of health care on both the care delivery and payer side.  

During my time with the Cigna Group, I led the analytics response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-functional team developed a disease registry, provided information to US government agencies (CDC, FDA), updated the Executive Leadership team on a bi-weekly basis, and used machine learning/predictive analytics to create predictions to assist in planning responses. 

After the pandemic, I explored the state of vitality in the United States and abroad along with health attitudes, behaviors, social determinants of health, and experiences with the health care system.

Prior to joining Cigna, I spent almost 15 years with Kaiser Permanente working in strategy management, population health technology, and leading a large organization change in how analytics were organized and delivered.  I started my Kaiser journey building scorecards and dashboards for clinical teams to align strategic goals and operational activities. I was next the chief product owner for population health applications supervising the end-to-end build and maintenance of disease registries, analytics insights, and clinical process automation. As director of the Data Analytics and Reporting Excellence program I drove standards across the analytics teams, partnered with IT-data engineering in data governance, and supported the adoption of agile project management methodologies across 134 analysts and data scientists. 

Prior to moving to industry, I worked full time for four years in academia teaching courses in argumentation, public speaking, and small group communication. I am proud to have coached the 1993 college debate champions from Kansas State University. 

I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois-Urbana, my M.A. at Kansas State University and my B.A. at Concordia College-Moorhead.
